# Final-Project

This project is designed to call on the Craiglist API, for which there is not a very good one. It will gather the data parse the xml using SwiftyXML parser and store that data in the core data. Once this is complete, it will display in a tableview the results of your search and location with a picture title and details. If you are interested in one of the items you can click on it and it will load up the browser to the craigslist add itself. 

This app is designed to be a catalog for craigslist and grant easy access without have to go to the browser and sift through craigslist massive application. This simplifies the way to search for products and devices that the user wants. 

For anyone trying to fork or run this. Ensure you run it using the Final Project.xcworkspace file.
